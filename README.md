A simple programme to calculate the expected return of an equity.

This programme utilizes the CAPM financial formula, in order to calculate the expected return of an equity, portfolio or financial instrument. The objective of this project was to implement the formula in a user-friendly interface. Overall, the user can use the programme with lacklustre financial or mathematical knowledge, but is required to obtain the 'Beta' value of their chosen equity. This can be found easily online (along with the Risk-free rate and Expected Market return), or calculated if the user wishes to do so. 

Hopefully, an integrated 'beta' value calculator will be in the next update.
